# React CRUD Application
A CRUD application using React and jQuery.  This application has server and client components, each of which is located in either the 'server' or 'client' folders in this directory.

### Comparison: React and AngularJS

Angular is a full MVC framework, while React is not really considered a framework, but rather an enhanced view renderer.  Angular has built-in functions on the $http object to carry out REST requests while React uses jQuery ajax requests.  

Angular utilizes controllers and data is bound to the scope of a given controller.  The comparative construct in React is the class, which uses the prop and state objects to store and manipulate data in the virtual DOM.  Angular utilizes two-way data binding by synchronizing data between the model and view using directives. This can cause problems when the amount of data gets larger. Meanwhile, React's data flow is uni-directional, where the virtual DOM is updated when it detects changes in the state of a class.  

Although we have yet to see this based upon our limited use of both React and Angular, React has been said to be more performance driven when compared to Angular.  In addition, some claim that debugging is harder in Angular than it is in React.
